Hello world! This is my first blog post.

###  The Bad
#### Good knowledge, bad motives
I have a feeling that most of the engineers are not working on good problems.
They are just building previous solutions either to practise, to improve their knowledge or to showcase their expertise.
The main motive behind this showcasing of the expertise is to get hired, get recognition, earn money, etc. All these motives are selfish in a broader sense. Hence, such direction will only lead to dissatisfaction at the end of the road.
Ex: People studying in top schools and building (no real value or brain spoiling) startups.
<br>
<br>

### The Good
#### Good Knowledge, Good motives
There are few engineers whose main motive is to build something that makes the world a better place. They are not selfish. Every child will have this dream. But as they grow up, they will have a realisation that money is essential to take care of our basic needs. While running behind money, they modify the dream unknowingly. (channeling life into earning money/recognition instead of making the world a better place). This too is selfishness. I have constantly noticed this dream modification since the start of my career.
Now is the time that I take back control and steer in the right direction.
Ex: People who do anonymous donations for value adding initiatives

### The Ugly
#### No Knowledge, No motives
These people neither try to gain knowledge or have any good intentions. They are just slaves to thier senses and pleasures.
<br>
<br>

### Bottom line
Our metrics should be updated from valuations to value add to the world, from revenue to number of lives positively impacted.
I have a feeling that many pressing problems can be solved using basic ML/DL concepts. We should think in that direction instead of chasing benchmark improvements with complex algorithms and the never ending fads in this AI phase.
